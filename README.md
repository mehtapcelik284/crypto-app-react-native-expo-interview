# Kriptok

React Native application bootstrapped with Expo Router.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the project

All commands will open the Expo CLI where you can launch Android, iOS, or web targets.

- Development: `npm run start:dev`
- Staging: `npm run start:staging`
- Production preview: `npm run start:prod`

If you prefer the default Expo flow, you can still run `npm start` (or `npx expo start`).

## Resetting the template

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This moves the starter code to `app-example/` and creates a blank `app/` folder for a fresh start.
